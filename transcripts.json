You may be aware of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. This was, in fact, the trigger which set off the war from a number of underlying causes. These were: Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism, and Nationalism. Militarism created an arms race out of competition and fear of neighboring nations. Germany tried to compete in a naval race with Britain, building more and more ships. Alliances were created to check the balance of power between nations. in 1882, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy formed the Triple Alliance. France, Britain, and Russia reacted in 1907 by creating the Triple Entente. Imperialism caused another type of competition and disagreement. The British and French empires made Germany jealous as it tried to colonize parts of Africa. Nationalism created the feeling that countries were better than others, and promoted the anti-Austro-Hungarian sentiments in Serbia. Seven young Bosnian Serbs, who were part of the nationalist Black Hand, planned to assassinate Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary.

"021": "- [Narrator] Researchers have\nfound that the COVID-19 virus begins the process of creating copies by attaching its spikes to a host cell. Those spikes offer a target for vaccines. With the right preparations, our immune system can\nutilize this vulnerability. A vaccine is used to\narm our immune system. It contains messenger RNA, which can direct cells to\nmake specific proteins. The messenger RNA tells our\ncells to produce COVID spikes. These harmless spikes\ngive our immune system the information needed to quickly detect a coronavirus infection and produce the appropriate antibodies. The new antibodies respond once\nCOVID has entered the body. They attach themselves to the\nspikes on the COVID virus, rendering the spikes useless, protecting our cells and keeping\nthe virus from reproducing. mRNA vaccines have been studied rigorously and are a safe and effective way to defend ourselves against\nCOVID-19 infections.", "022": "Recognize this sound? If you pop or crack your joints, you probably\ndo. What happens to our joints when we crack them? And is it bad for you? Synovial fluid is this lubricant-like substance\nthat's found in between your joints. It kind of looks like an egg yolk. So when you stretch out your joint, you are\nreleasing gas, and that gas forms a bubble and it collapses and pops. In order to crack the same knuckle again,\nyou have to wait about 20 minutes for the gas to return back to that fluid. So how is that different from a pop you hear\nwhen you stand up quickly? The sound you're probably hearing then is\nthe snapping sound tendons make when slide between muscles or over bones. When a joint moves, the tendon snaps quickly\nover and it makes a popping sound. So is the knuckle cracking habit safe? Probably. Donald Unger was sort of a self-described\nresearcher who chose to pop the joints in one of his hands for 60 years, but not the\nother one. And he wanted to find out if popping your\nknuckles would actually give you arthritis. After 60 years of doing it, he found that\nhe didn't have any more arthritis in one hand than in the other. But there's still a chance it's not good for\nyou. One 1990 did find that cracking your knuckles\nover a long period of time led to hand swelling and decreased scrip strength, but there hasn't\nbeen any follow-up research on that. So while cracking your knuckles might not\nbe bad for you, there's still no guarantee that your popping habit won't annoy the people\naround you.", "024": "Contact.
